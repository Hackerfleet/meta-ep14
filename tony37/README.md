This seems to be an area of black magic. It is possible that a command-line script
comparable to livecd-iso-to-disk or unetbootin or ... would be possible and, if well
documented, provide an introduction to this for others.

For example, what is the difference between a stick with a 'live' iso and one to be
installed (e.g. kickstart)? What is required by a uefi 'bios' vs a legacy bios? Why
does the usb stick need to be formated as ext2 (or does it or part of it)?

later a Doku will be here:
